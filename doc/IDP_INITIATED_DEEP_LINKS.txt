IdP-Initiated Deep Links
========================
Some Service Points require an IdP-initiated conversation. To achieve this,
the IdP must have some way to link deeply to an SP resource.

SAML2IDP_LINKS setting
======================
The SAML2IDP_LINKS dictionary maps a named resource to a URL pattern on the SP.

For example:

DEEP_LINKS = {
    #named resource: URL pattern
    'starwars': 'https://www.starwars.com/%s.php',
}

For example, this IdP link to the "vader" target:

https://idp.example.com/init/starwars/vader/

Will map to this URL on the SP:

https://www.starwars.com/vader.php

NOTE: These example URLs are totally bogus. Don't expect them to actually work!

LIMITATIONS
===========
Both the named resource and the target must be alphanumeric only.
