INTEGRATION WITH django-saml2-sp
================================
A reference Service Point has been implementated in the django-saml2-sp project
at http://code.google.com/p/django-saml2-sp/.


NOTE: Currently, the django-saml2-sp implementation is only compatible with
tag "demo1" of this project, available at:

    https://django-saml2-idp.googlecode.com/svn/tags/demo1

You can run that sample project at the same time as the sample project here.
You can even run them using Django's built-in test server, like this:

In the first terminal window:
$ cd path/to/idptest/
$ python manage.py syncdb
    NOTE: Don't forget to create a user account, which you will use to login.
$ python manage.py runserver 8000

In the second terminal window:
$ cd path/to/sptest/
$ python manage.py syncdb
    NOTE: Create a different user account, so it doesn't conflict with the other.
$ python manage.py runserver 9000

You can browse to the Service Point @ http://127.0.0.1:9000/ to get the flow
started. Make sure to watch the output in each window, to see the order of
message flow.
