INTEGRATING WITH simpleSAMLphp
==============================

No Official Support
-------------------
This project is not officially targeted at integration with simpleSAMLphp
Service Points. However, you may be able to use either the Google Apps or the
SalesForce Processors.

Certificates
------------
The certificate and private key files have been borrowed from the simpleSAMLphp
project. This allows easier testing, using simpleSAMLphp itself as a reference
implementation.

You can find these files at:

/idptest/keys/sample/sample-certificate.pem
/idptest/keys/sample/sample-private-key.pem
